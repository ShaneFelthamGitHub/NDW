$contentDescription = 'Hydro-Jetting consists of a high-pressure hose with a specialized nozzle connected to a machine that pressurizes the water, producing a powerful stream that clears the drain. Hydro-Jetting is usually done through a clean-out, which is an opening that allows plumbers to clean out clogs. The water is forced down the drain, where it pushes grease, mineral build-up, hair and other debris through the drain. With a powerful enough Hydro-Jet, tree roots can also be broken up. However, before using a Hydro-Jet, a plumber typically inspects the drain with a small camera to determine if the pipe is damaged.';

                    <h3>5 Key Benefits of Hydro-Jet Cleaning your Sewer Lines and Drains</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Cleaning, not just unclogging.</strong></li>
                        <p>Accumulations of grease, silt, fats, soap, detergents, dirt, mineral deposits and other components of sludge inside the pipe are often the precursor to recurrent sewer clogs. Unfortunately, a rotating snake does little other than punch a hole in the clog to restore flow. It doesn’t address the ongoing issues of sludge that are likely to result in a recurrence very soon. Hydro-Jetting cleans the internal pipe for a more long-lasting resolution. High pressure Hydro-Jetting can also be used to remove roots in drains by using specialized cutting tools driven by the water jets. Hydro-Jet cleaning is ideal for sewer lines, kitchen blocked drains, laundry lines, tubs, showers, lavatory sinks and floor drains.</p>
                        <li><strong>Accurate and Consistent Cleaning.Accurate and Consistent Cleaning.</strong></li>
                        <p>One of the best things about Hydro-Jetting is the ability to clear underground drain pipes without having to dig up your yard. The high pressure water stream goes through the sewer system spinning both water and sand from multiple angles to ensure the drain pipes are clean and clear. This is particularly useful when cleaning drains in homes with corroded pipes and infrastructure that you would otherwise have to damage just to remove the clog.</p>
                        <li><strong>Powerful and Efficient for Residual Removal.</strong></li>
                        <p>Hydro-Jet cleaning is more efficient than many other drain cleaning methods. It has the ability to penetrate deeper into built up debris, and flush out roots, rocks, minerals, and any other obstructions that can clog up and get caked onto your pipes. Hydro-Jets come in different sizes, so an experienced plumber can determine the appropriate pressure force to remove debris without damaging the pipes.</p>
                        <li><strong>Removing Bacteria.</strong></li>
                        <p>The stream of water is so forceful that it removes not only the grease, soap, and scum build up, but also any bacteria that settles in your drains from your kitchen or bathroom, resulting in a myriad of problems. If you’re experiencing foul smells from your drains, Hydro-Jetting can help address that issue and leave your drain pipes clean and fresh.</p>
                        <li><strong>More economical and environmentally safe.</strong></li>
                        <p>A single pipe cleaning with a Hydro-Jetting system can delay the need for another service call to clear blockages or tree roots up to four times longer than a typical procedure with a mechanical snake. This reduces sewer service expenses over the long term. Unlike conventional snake-type cleaners that break up debris only to re-clog later on or sometimes harmful and dangerous liquids are used, jet water removes the clog completely, safely, preventing self-healing clogs of substances such as grease from re-forming and in a very environmentally safe. While traditional drain cleaning should be done a minimum of two times a year, Hydro-Jetting is so detailed that it secures your pipes against clogs for several years, saving you money in the long run.</p>
