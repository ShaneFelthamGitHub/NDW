                    <p><strong>Video Inspection Saves You BIG MONEY... Now, and in The Future!</strong> Before Plumbing Video Cameras, plumbers had to use educated 'guess-work' (or trial-and-error) to locate plumbing issues and blockages. This, with no guarantee that the plumber could find the source of the problem without having to dig up a large portion of your lawn, or spend hours trying to locate your plumbing problem.</p>

                    <p>This is why National Drains &amp; Water are offering for a limited time a 100% free of charge CCTV drain survey’s as a proactive advisory measure to avoid costly and difficult excavations meaning the home or business owner would then have to become re-active. Also to alert property owners to issues with their drainage systems before they deteriorate beyond repair.</p>

                    <h3>Benefits of our CCTV Video Inspection and Survey?</h3>
                    <p>Often, drains will become blocked because of the items either flushed down the toilet (sanitary items, dental floss, nappies), or disposed of down the sink (food, oil, grease, fat). However, drains can also become blocked because of structural damage or even ingress from tree roots. The experts at Natiobwide Drainage Services Ltd will be able to identify the cause of any blockages using state of the art survey equipment.</p>

                    <h4>How CCTV Video Inspection Works</h4>
                    <p>We use the latest Video Cameras to identify pipe damage and obstructions that inhibit proper plumbing flow, as well as those that may create occasional or repeated backups.</p>
                    <p>A flexible rod with a high-resolution color video camera on its tip is inserted by our plumber into the pipe for your plumbing inspection. As the cable is pushed through the pipe, the protected, waterproof camera, equipped with powerful lights, records the findings within the inside of your plumbing pipe. Video images are transmitted to a video monitor where our plumber technician views the problem in real-time, and thus makes an informed diagnosis of any problems found. The plumber will then show you the plumbing problem as it is identified.</p>
                    <p>When inspecting pipes that are deeper in the ground, radio transmitters on the Plumbing Video Camera record the depth and physical location from the surface so that defects and obstructions within your plumbing can be more precisely located, correctly identified and be resolved in a more cost effective manner.</p>
                    <p>The video of your plumbing pipe can also be saved onto a digital computer disk and provided at your request. Following your service, our Plumbing Video Camera Inspections can also verify that obstructions have been eliminated and that your plumbing lines are now clean.</p>

                    <h3>Does CCTV Video Inspection and Survey Provides Early Identification of Problems?</h3>
                    <p>Yes this is the most reliable way to see what years of hard dirty living has done to the pipes below our feet.</p>
                    <p>Broken, cracked or collapsed plumbing pipes - Damaged pipes that require repair or replacement.</p>
                    <p>Offset plumbing pipe - A pipe that has become misaligned due to conditions such as shifting soil, frozen ground, settling, etc.</p>
                    <p>Blockage in your plumbing or sewer pipe - Proper flow is restricted due to foreign object, infiltration of roots, or build-up of grease in the plumbing line.</p>
                    <p>Plumbing corrosion - The plumbing pipe has deteriorated and/or broken, which causes sections of the pipe to collapse and restrict water flow.</p>
                    <p>Bellied plumbing pipes - When a section of the pipe becomes sunken due to conditions in the soil or ground, it results in a low point in the pipe that collects paper and waste.</p>
                    <p>Leaking joints in plumbing - Seals between connecting pipes deteriorate over time resulting in leaks.</p>
                    <p>Root infiltration - Tree or shrub roots invade plumbing pipes or sewer lines, causing blockage, preventing normal cleaning, or causing damage to your plumbing pipe.</p>
                    <p>Off-grade plumbing pipe - Existing pipes are constructed of substandard or outdated material; the plumbing pipe then may become corroded or deteriorated over time</p>

                    <h3>When are CCTV surveys necessary?</h3>
                    <p>If you experience recurring drainage issues - slow flushing toilets, regular blockages etc. - then a CCTV survey should get to the root cause, allowing your contractor to resolve the problem for good. A CCTV survey can identify issues that would otherwise remain hidden, so it’s definitely useful to have a survey done if you think something is amiss.</p>
