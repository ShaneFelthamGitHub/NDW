$contentDescription = 'Drain clogs are a problem for every homeowner, business, comercial, industrial and institutional establishment at some point. Materials build up and get stuck in toilets, sink drains, showers, bath tubs and in your main sewer line because of tree roots that result in slow drains or overflows. If your plunger won’t move the clog, you need something a little more powerful. Professional plumbers often use a plumbing auger/ snake or a Hydro-Jet when clogs just won’t budge. Each is designed for different types of clogs.';

                    <p>Plumbing Auger/ Snakes Plumbing snakes, also called plumbing augers, consist of a long metal tube at one end with a cable inside that has a corkscrew auger or blades attached, and a hand or motorized crank at the other. The cable end of the snake is placed in the drain and you turn the crank end to extend the cable down the drain. When it reaches the clog you can feel the resistance and must turn the crank to push through the clog and then pull it out of the drain. Plumbing snakes may have a straight tube or a J-shaped bend. The straight tube style is intended for sink drains, while the J-shaped snakes are intended for toilets.</p>

                    <h3>What is Hydro-Jetting?</h3>
                    
                    <p>Hydro-Jetting consists of a high-pressure hose with a specialized nozzle connected to a machine that pressurizes the water, producing a powerful stream that clears the drain. Hydro-Jetting is usually done through a clean-out, which is an opening that allows plumbers to clean out clogs. The water is forced down the drain, where it pushes grease, mineral build-up, hair and other debris through the drain. With a powerful enough Hydro-Jet, tree roots can also be broken up. However, before using a Hydro-Jet, a plumber typically inspects the drain with a small camera to determine if the pipe is damaged.</p>

                    <h3>Pros and Cons</h3>

                    <p>A plumbing snake is ideal for minor clogs or when an item such as a toy gets stuck in the drain. If your plunger doesn’t remove the material, a snake is usually enough to remove most clogs. Snakes can also alert you to more serious problems. For example, if it can’t break through the material, you may have a tree root in the line, and not a buildup of hair. A Hydro-Jet, on the other hand, doesn’t just break up clogs, it clears your plumbing lines of material that builds up on pipe walls, such as minerals and grease. Snaking doesn’t thoroughly clean your pipes, so it is a temporary solution to many types of clogs. While Hydro-Jetting can clear almost any clog, it's not an option for the do-it-yourselfer. Hydro-Jetting should be done by a professional plumber to avoid damaging your plumbing.</p>

                    <p>The Best Choice The best way to clear your clogged plumbing lines depends on the cause of the problem. Plumbing snakes are ideal for slow-draining lines or to remove occasional blockages, such as too much toilet paper or food stuck in your sink drain however this will most likely result in a temporary fix as the drain will eventually become plugged again. For very slow moving drains or completely plugged, then Hydro-Jetting is quick, economical, environmentally safe and is a long-term solution. Hydro-Jetting is a solution that’s best used when clogs can’t be removed using a plumbing snake, such as major build up of sludge and grease that has built up over time, or tree roots.</p>
