$contentDescription = 'Drain relining using non-dig technology is affective way to repair damaged drains without excavation, giving the benefits of minimal disruption combined with the fastest and most cost-effective way to repair a damaged drain. It involves installing a new pipe or lining which bonds to the inside of the damaged pipe by a method known as inversion. This uses water or air pressure to fit the lining tightly against the wall of the damaged pipe restoring the free flowing function of the drain or sewer.';

                <p>Lining applied to damaged drains prevents further deterioration of the drains and so eliminates any leaks into the surrounding ground which could lead to subsidence. The drain lining process is approved by local authorities, surveyors, civil engineers, and architects.</p>
                
                <p>Drain relining can be applied in single lengths or by using shorter, overlapping liners depending on access and logistics. Patch liners can be used for smaller drains or isolated cracks and breaks within a drain.</p>

                <p>Broken drain repair work is often covered by your buildings insurance. With your authority we will be authorised to speak directly with your insurer while we fix the problem.

                <h4>How does it work?</h4>
                
                <p><strong>Sewer Line Inspection.</strong></p>
                
                <p>One of our professional plumbers will access the sewer line and perform a video camera inspection. This video camera inspection first checks to see if there are any damaged or broken pipes. They will then identify the areas the are damaged or look to need repair soona. See CCTV Survey how you can get it done for FREE click here.</p>

                <h4>Pressure Jetting the line</h4>
                
                <p>Once the line has been inspected and issue areas assessed, the professional plumber will insert a special hose and cleaning head which can deliver over 7,000 PSI and up to 60,000 PSI of pressure to the line. The cleaning head is advanced along the run paying special attention to issue areas.</p>
                <p>Typically several passes are made to fully clean away tough blockages such as tree roots and grease/ gunk build up.</p>

                <h4>Quality Inspection</h4>
                
                <p>The sewer line is once again inspected with a sewer line video camera to ensure that any buildup or roots have been removed and that the line is clear and functioning at maximum possible capacity.</p>

                <p><strong>High pressure (water) Hydro-Jetting cleaning accomplishes two key objectives.</strong></p>
                
                <p>The Breakup and Flushing of deposits blocking your sewer line flow. Water jetting has the power to burst open the toughest blockages A pressure washing of the “walls” of the sewer line and at the same time scours the full diameter of the pipe, flushing debris and leaving lines clear with no damage to the drain pipes.</p>

                <h3>5 Key Benefits of Hydro-Jet Cleaning your Sewer Lines and Drains</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Cleaning, not just unclogging.</strong></li>
                    <p>Accumulations of grease, silt, fats, soap, detergents, dirt, mineral deposits and other components of sludge inside the pipe are often the precursor to recurrent sewer clogs. Unfortunately, a rotating snake does little other than punch a hole in the clog to restore flow. It doesn’t address the ongoing issues of sludge that are likely to result in a recurrence very soon. Hydro-Jetting cleans the internal pipe for a more long-lasting resolution. High pressure Hydro-Jetting can also be used to remove roots in drains by using specialized cutting tools driven by the water jets. Hydro-Jet cleaning is ideal for sewer lines, kitchen blocked drains, laundry lines, tubs, showers, lavatory sinks and floor drains.</p>
                    <li><strong>Accurate and Consistent Cleaning.Accurate and Consistent Cleaning.</strong></li>
                    <p>One of the best things about Hydro-Jetting is the ability to clear underground drain pipes without having to dig up your yard. The high pressure water stream goes through the sewer system spinning both water and sand from multiple angles to ensure the drain pipes are clean and clear. This is particularly useful when cleaning drains in homes with corroded pipes and infrastructure that you would otherwise have to damage just to remove the clog.</p>
                    <li><strong>Powerful and Efficient for Residual Removal.</strong></li>
                    <p>Hydro-Jet cleaning is more efficient than many other drain cleaning methods. It has the ability to penetrate deeper into built up debris, and flush out roots, rocks, minerals, and any other obstructions that can clog up and get caked onto your pipes. Hydro-Jets come in different sizes, so an experienced plumber can determine the appropriate pressure force to remove debris without damaging the pipes.</p>
                    <li><strong>Removing Bacteria.</strong></li>
                    <p>The stream of water is so forceful that it removes not only the grease, soap, and scum build up, but also any bacteria that settles in your drains from your kitchen or bathroom, resulting in a myriad of problems. If you’re experiencing foul smells from your drains, Hydro-Jetting can help address that issue and leave your drain pipes clean and fresh.</p>
                    <li><strong>More economical and environmentally safe.</strong></li>
                    <p>A single pipe cleaning with a Hydro-Jetting system can delay the need for another service call to clear blockages or tree roots up to four times longer than a typical procedure with a mechanical snake. This reduces sewer service expenses over the long term. Unlike conventional snake-type cleaners that break up debris only to re-clog later on or sometimes harmful and dangerous liquids are used, jet water removes the clog completely, safely, preventing self-healing clogs of substances such as grease from re-forming and in a very environmentally safe. While traditional drain cleaning should be done a minimum of two times a year, Hydro-Jetting is so detailed that it secures your pipes against clogs for several years, saving you money in the long run.</p>
