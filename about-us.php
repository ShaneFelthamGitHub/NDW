                <p>There is a wide range of tools and technology available to both residential and comercial plumbing contractors, both to diagnose problems, and to fix them. The list is ever changing and expanding, but the following are just a few examples:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>High-Tech Video Cameras</strong> – Some plumbers use video cameras to determine where and what the problem is. Generally, it will involve a tiny camera affixed to a fibre-optic cable, which is fed through piping to the scene of the problem. The camera with live-feed can help plumbers determine exactly what’s causing a blockage, or what sort of repair is required.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Hydro Jetting</strong> – No, it's not a variation on jet skiing. A hydro jet system is a powerful high-pressure hose that can be used to clear blockages quickly and effectively.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Electric Drain Augers</strong> – Sometimes also referred to as drain snakes, these are electrically powered devices that can break through unwanted material that has clogged drains.
                    </li>
